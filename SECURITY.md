## For kununu developers

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Jira is our entrypoint to report security vulnerabilities. Having this in mind a KUNSECU user story (type Vulnerability) needs to be created. 

#### How to fill the user story? 

Follow this [documentation](https://new-work.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/kununu/pages/47846323/Vulnerability+Issue+Type+Jira).

#### To which team do I assign the user story? 

Follow the [domain ownership matrix](https://new-work.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/kununu/pages/113148000/Domain+ownership+matrix) and assign it to the corresponding team.

## Reporting the update of dependencies

This is the benefit of having Dependabot. It will open pull requests for security and version updates. For more information check the GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-pull-requests-for-dependency-updates).
